    "This file serves to host an ANN model created for use in multi-robot task allocation (MRTA). This model performs regression based on the load history of a robot, its distance to the current task, as well as the total distance that it has travelled thus far. The goal for designing this ANN is to comapre its performance against an ANFIS to determine which is better at approximating an FIS. This will be achieved through comparing the coefficient of determination ($R^{2}$), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).\n",
